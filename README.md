# Culture Works Tone Analyzer

## Repository Objectives

Integration the Webapp and Chrome extension with the REST APIs

## Project background

This project will create a tool that allows people to understand his or her tone in written communications.
It will aggregate specific communications and provide the user with a tone profile dashboard, which may also be exported to PDF.
The tone profile will give individuals awareness of how he or she typically communicates with others.
The tone is analyzed by sending the written text through the Watson Tone Analyzer APIs, then it is aggregated to present a holistic score per person. Additionally, the tool must be able to present a score for single written communications as they are drafted.
